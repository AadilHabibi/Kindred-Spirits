Recursive Binary Tree Comparison

Program was designed to trace through a Binary Trie. It was designed to detect if each branch of the binary trie is a reflection of it. For example, if the right branch of the Trie is in the same order as the left branch of the Trie. Additionally, it was built to detect if the Preorder of a trie is a post-order of another trie.
